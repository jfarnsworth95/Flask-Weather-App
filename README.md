# Flask-Weather-App
Testing out Flask, using OpenWeather API for getting weather data, and Bootstrap to make things look bearable

I didn't include my API key for OpenWeather. I suggest you grab one (all you need is an account) from them, and put it in the "open_weather_api_key" variable under the "api_caller.py" file.
